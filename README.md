# Hey there 👋

I'm Avesta, a software engineer and AI enthusiast based in Türkiye.

I build practical, data-driven and performance-oriented systems, with a focus on usability, clarity, and clean engineering approaches.

This GitHub profile is my personal lab. I share ML experiments, small projects, and things I'm actively learning or researching — especially in machine learning, computer vision, and game development.

## Design & Dev Philosophy

- Clarity over complexity
- Code should be understandable before it’s clever
- Good abstractions reduce long-term cost
- Research + Iteration over jumping to conclusions
- If it’s not useful, it doesn’t belong
