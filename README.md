# Hey there 👋

I'm **Avesta**, a frontend-focused software engineer and designer based in Türkiye.

I build **clean, minimal, and performance-oriented interfaces**, with a strong focus on usability, visual clarity, and subtle motion.

This GitHub profile is my personal lab. I share small projects, UI experiments, and things I’m actively working on. Everything here is crafted from scratch — no templates, no shortcuts.

## Tools & Tech

* **React**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**
* **Framer Motion** for micro-interactions and animations
* **Figma**, **Procreate**, Apple Notes for design, sketching, and ideation

## A Bit About Me

* 🎮 Interested in gaming, streaming visuals, and UI systems
* 🎌 Anime enjoyer — *Demon Slayer* is a favorite
* 🧠 I like systems that are simple, logical, and easy to maintain
* ✨ I care about details most people don’t notice

---

## Design & Dev Philosophy

* Minimal UI over visual noise
* Motion should support meaning, not distract
* Code should be readable before it is clever
* If it’s not useful, it doesn’t belong
