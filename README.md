# Hey there 👋

I'm **Avesta Atabay**, a software engineer specialized in **software development, machine learning**, and **game development**, based in Türkiye.

I build **practical, scalable, and user-oriented systems**, with a focus on clean architecture, performance, and clarity.  
My work spans **ML pipelines**, **computer vision**, **full-stack development**, and **game development** (Unity & C#).

This GitHub profile is my personal lab. I share ML research projects, computer vision work, experimental apps, and game prototypes. Everything here is crafted from scratch — no templates, no shortcuts.
