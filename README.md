# Hey there 👋

I'm **Avesta Atabay**, a software engineer specialized in **software development, machine learning**, and **game development**, based in Türkiye.

I build **practical, scalable, and user-oriented systems**, with a focus on clean architecture, performance, and clarity.  
My work spans **ML pipelines**, **computer vision**, and **game development** (Unity & C#).

This GitHub profile is my personal lab — where I explore ideas, experiment with systems, and build things I find meaningful.  
Every project is crafted from scratch, with care and intention — no shortcuts. ✨

- **If it doesn’t add value, it doesn’t belong**  
- **Consistency creates quality**
